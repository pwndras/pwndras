- 👋 Hi, I’m @pwndras

I'm a DBA of a couple years at this point.
I'm studying for various AWS certifications, 2 down more to go. Currently studying for the 'Certified Developer Associate'.

It's been awhile since I've used git, so thought I return and get familiar again with it so that I am comfortable shoudl we get CICD integrated with our data plaform enviornment at work :)
